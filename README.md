# Mobile-Navigation

Can someone please explain why the Javascript is not working? When I click the hamburger menu it should toggle a 'show' class but for 
some reason it is not working. I have double checked and triple checked the code but cannot see what is wrong (obviously something 
is wrong as its not working).
